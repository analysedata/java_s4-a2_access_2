/* Session 4 Assignment 2:

 * 	What will happen if you instantiate a child object of parent type (Parent p = new Child()), and invoke a
 	parent public method from the child object, and then invoke a parent private method called from the same parent method?

 * 	Answer:
 		C. Prints : Parent's method2() 
            		Parent's method1()
            	
 * 	Explanation:
		"Parent's method2()" prints because you can instantiate a new Child object of type Parent.
		This child object is limited to parent methods but child methods can be accessed through casting: ((Child)p).method1().

		Private methods can be accessed by sibling methods, so "Parent's method1()" prints next.
		Private methods cannot be accessed from the child.
